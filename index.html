        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>  
        <p>I am a determined, hardworking and creative person with a passion to work in web development.
            I have a history of working in TV & film production, and an educational background in graphic design, as well as multimedia technology. 
            Working and studying in these varied areas has allowed me to gain a number of fundamental skills. 
            My time in the fast paced world of production meant organisation and attention to detail were vital. It taught me to find solutions to problems quickly under stressful circumstances.
            My background in design and multimedia technology also played a fundamental role in my attention to detail, and has sparked my renewed desire to get work in web development. It gave me the opportunity to learn graphic design, as well as a bit of html, CSS and Javascript.
